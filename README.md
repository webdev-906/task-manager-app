Task Tracker Application 

Functionality: Enter tasks in the input to add tasks.  The tasks you remove get's added to completed tasks.


Thought Process: Target the user's inputed task and add it as list items.  

Error(s)

1. I needed to figure out a way for the user to add in any task they wanted.  In the server.js file, task is a empty array. Orginally the array was filled in with strings with hard coded tasks.  Removing those allows the user to enter in anything they want.
